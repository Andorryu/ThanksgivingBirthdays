### Desc

My girlfriend's birthday falls on November 23rd and Thanksgiving falls on the fourth Thursday of November. Sometimes Thanksgiving lands on her birthday, that is, November 23rd. After looking up her birthday for the next 100 years, we noticed a pattern. Every thanksgiving birthday minus the previous one provided this pattern:

6
11
6
5

that repeated consistently...
...until 2102, which provided a difference of 12 years...
Why is the pattern described above different when we reach 2102?

Answer: Leap year is weird, most people probably think it just occurs every 4 years but that's not completely true. Leap year occurs under the following conditions:

If the year is divisible by 4 and the year is not divisible by 100
or
If the year is divisible by 400
